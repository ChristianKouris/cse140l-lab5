In order to change the top level file to be synthsesizable, I made it so that anything that was reading from the core had to use raddr and data_out and anything that was writing to the core had to use waddr and data_in from the dat_mem module. Instead of using many for loops to access the core, I decided to use cases instead and have the clock update the raddr and waddr adresses. Instead of using a 2D array to hold all of the states for the LFSR trials, I opted to use the lfsr6 module used in Lab4 because we only need the 6th state for all 6 patterns.
